# The-ULTIMATE-Magic-The-Gathering-Card-Predictioner
---
A small project I created to predict outcomes of cards based on what type of shuffle they do and how many, how often mixed, and used for games specifically Magic The Gathering.

## What is it about?
This is a small project I created because my father told me he could predict his next card and mine, based on his computed shuffle and the probability of his hand, which sparked an idea for a while. I already did this before when I was still using Windows 10, but now that I have swapped to Linux Arch and use Neovim, I am still practicing and learning.
